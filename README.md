The interdisciplinary research group "Audio-Visual Rhetorics of Affect" is an ongoing collaboration (2017-2021) between the [film studies department](https://www.ada.cinepoetics.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) of [Freie Universt√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) and the [Semantic Technologies Group](https://hpi.de/meinel/knowledge-tech/former-topics/semantics.html) of the [Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering (HPI)](https://hpi.de/en/index.html) in Potsdam.

On this website we publish and describe all technical results of the project developed at the HPI. Currently, this is all semantic data and all linked data applications that were generated and developed within the project. The data of the AdA project, the ontology and the annotations on this website and in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ProjectAdA/public) are made available on the Web under the the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License).
